--LEADERCARDS WITH PERMANENT EFFECTS--

-Ludovico Ariosto: GameLogic.PlaceFamMember() verifies whether the space is already occupied or not. 

-Ludovico il Moro: setOrangeValue(), setBlackValue(), setWhiteValue() check if the fixedOrangeValue in the PlacementModifier is set: in this case, the setting is refused.

-Lucrezia Borgia:  Player.getBlackValue(), adds bonusBlackValue to the return value. The same applies for the other members.

-Sisto IV: At the beginning GameLogic.vaticanReport() gets from Match the VaticanSupportRequirement and the ExcommunicationCard . Then it checks every Player's FaithPoints and if they are enough it calls the Player.vaticanSupport(). The player returns TRUE, resets his faith points and checks whether the player add VaticanSupportBonus to VictoryPoints if he doesn't want Excommunication or returns FALSE if he wants to keep his points.

-Filippo Brunelleschi: if the chosen place is already occupied, GameLogic.placeFamMember() calls the Player.payForOccupiedTower(). The Player.payForOccupiedTower() checks if the Player.advancedModifiers.noPayOccupiedTower is TRUE: in this case, it allow the player to occupy the space without paying.

-Cesare Borgia: Player.checkMilitaryForTerritory() returns always TRUE if Player.AdvancedModifier.noMilitaryForTerritory=TRUE.

-Santa Rita: each activate() method in the PropEffect methods calls Player.getDoubleResourcesMod(): if it returns TRUE, than the activate() methoud doubles the number of resources added to the player.

-Pico della Mirandola: when you have to take a card from the board, the GameLogic.placeFamMember() detects that the space is a TowerSpace and calls the Player.checkRequirements() and then, if the requirements are met, the Player.PayRequirements() is called; then, the GameLogic.placeFamMember() will call the getCard() method in the space. Player.checkRequirements() and Player.payRequirements() will reduce the requirements by Player.buildingCardDiscount value.

--INSTANT LEADERCARDS--
When the activate() method is called on these cards, it checks if the LeaderCard.Activated is equal to FALSE: in this case, it sets that value to TRUE and activates the effect.

-Francesco Sforza and Leonardo da Vinci: In the Player.makeAction() routine, the player chooses to use this cards; the LeaderCard.activate() calls the  Player.makeExtraAction(WorkType, action_value) and then the GameLogic.work() is called.

-Federico da Montefeltro: the LeaderCard.activate() calls Player.chooseColor(), which returns a DICE_COLOR;  then the LeaderCard.activate() calls the appropriate Player.FamilyMember.setBlackValue()/setWhiteValue()/setOrangeValue()

--ENUM DESCRIPTION--

-ActionType: used in the Player.makeAction() method to determine which type of action the player wants to execute.
